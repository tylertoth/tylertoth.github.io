---Engineering plant-microbe communication for synthetic symbiosis. Interactions between plant roots and microbes in the soil can have positive (e.g. nitrogen fixation) or negative (e.g. crown gall disease) impacts on plant health. I am interested in building off of these native interactions to make engineerable tools for synthetic biology applications.
